# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This repository contains a heart disease prediction model that utilizes different algorithm to predict the risk of heart disease in patients.The dataset used in this model consists of 303 patients, with 14 attributes including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thallium stress test results, and the presence of heart disease (the target variable).

The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and categorical variables. The model has been trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 20%.

RESULT: Out of different Algorithms applied , Random Forest Algorithm best fits the model.
